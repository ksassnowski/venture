ðŸŽ‰ Check the upgrade guide here: https://laravel-venture.com/upgrade-guide.html#migrating-to-4-0-from-3-x

## [3.7.0] â€” 2022-07-09

### Added

- Added `when` and `unless` methods to `WorkflowDefinition` to conditionally add jobs to a workflow (#53)

## [3.6.5] â€” 2022-05-17

### Changed

- Replaced `opis/closure` with `laravel/serializable-closure` (#52). Keep `opis/closure` around
  as a dependency to preserve backwards compatibility with existing jobs that still used 
  `Opis\Closure\SerializableClosure` for their callbacks.

## [3.6.4] â€” 2022-04-16

### Fixed

- Moved `UnserializeException` to correct namespace

## [3.6.3] â€” 2022-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed serialization bug that could occur when using Postgres (#51)

## [3.6.2] â€” 2022-04-11

### Changed

- Add `markAsFinished()` method for overridability and make `markJobAsFinished` protected (#47). Credits, @stevebauman.

## [3.6.1] â€” 2022-04-10

### Fixed

- Fixes non-static method calls introduced in #44 (#48)

## [3.6.0] â€” 2022-04-05

## [3.5.0] â€” 2022-02-01

### Added

- Add support for Laravel 9 (#41)

## [3.4.0] â€” 2021-11-19

### Added

- Add `hasRan()` method to workflow to check if all jobs have at lease been attempted once (#37). Credits, @stevebauman.
- Add `JobExtractor` interface to extract a workflow job instance from a Laravel queue job. This gets used by
  the `WorkflowEventSubscriber` class.

## [3.3.2] â€” 2021-11-18

### Fixed

- Fix BC break if existing config was missing `workflow_step_id_generator_class` key. Credits, @stevebauman. (#40)

## [3.3.1] â€” 2021-11-18

### Changed

- Clone job instance before serializing it when saving the workflow to the database. This could
  lead to hard to track down bugs since `serialize` mutates the object in place.

## [3.3.0] â€” 2021-11-18

### Changed

- Added `StepIdGenerator` interface to abstract id generation for workflow steps (#39).

## [3.2.0] â€” 2021-11-16

### Changed

- Added `vimeo/psalm` dependency for static type checking during development.
- Added various missing type hints to get `psalm` to pass at level 2.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where `WorkflowDefinition::hasWorkflow()` wasn't working properly when checking
  for the workflow's `$dependencies`, too.

## [3.1.1] â€” 2021-05-13

### Changed

- Store step id instead of serialized instance for dependent jobs. This could cause
  an error in rare cases if the job payload was too big (#30). Credits, @connors511.

## [3.1.0] â€” 2021-04-21

### Added

- Added a `hasWorkflow` method to the `WorkflowDefinition` to check if a workflow contains 
  a nested workflow.

## [3.0.1] â€” 2021-04-20

### Changed

- Fixed possible race condition when multiple workers try to update the same workflow (#28). Credits, @connors511.

## [3.0.0] â€” 2021-03-30

### Added

- Added support for adding multiple instances of the same job to a workflow. Check the
  [documentation](https://laravel-venture.netlify.app/usage/duplicate-jobs.html) for more details.
  See #14 for the discussion on this feature. Special thanks to @conors511 for his help.

### Changed

- Change required minimum PHP version to 8.

### Removed

- Removed `addJobWithDelay` method from `WorkflowDefinition`. You should use `addJob`
  and provide the `delay` parameter instead. Since this version of Venture requires PHP 8,
  you can make use of named arguments to skip any default parameters you don't want to change.

## [2.1.1] â€” 2021-01-20

### Changed

- Specified minimum version for Laravel dependencies

## [2.1.0] â€” 2021-01-14

### Added

- Added `beforeNesting` hook to that gets called before a workflow gets added as a nested workflow. (#13)

### Changed

- Made `$dependencies` parameter optional in `addWorkflow` method of `WorkflowDefinition`. It now
  works the same as the `addJob` methods. (#20)

### Fixed

- Don't call `onStepFinished` method when a job was released back onto the queue (#21)

## [2.0.0] â€” 2021-01-12

### Added

- Added support for nested workflows

### Changed

- A job's dependencies have to be added to the workflow before the job itself is added.
  This also eliminates the problem of circular dependencies.
- All jobs in a workflow need to implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue` interface.
  Otherwise, a `NonQueueableWorkflowStepException` gets thrown.
- Starting a workflow now returns the workflow instance (#10)

## [1.2.1] â€“ 2020-12-14

### Changed

- The `WorkflowManagerFake` now calls the `beforeCreate` hook of the workflow definition, too.

## [1.2.0] â€“ 2020-12-10

### Changed

- Added PHP 8 support

## [1.1.1] â€“ 2020-11-20

### Changed

- Publish migrations
- Use file groups for publishable assets

## [1.1.0] â€“ 2020-11-16

### Added

- Added a `beforeCreate` hook to the `WorkflowDefinition` class to
  manipulate a workflow before it gets saved to the database for the
  first time.

### Changed

- Added missing `date` casts to the `finished_at` and `failed_at`
  columns on the `Workflow` model.

## [1.0.0] â€“ 2020-11-12

Please see the documentation's [upgrade guide](https://laravel-venture.netlify.app/upgrade-guide.html) to migrate from 0.x to 1.0.0.

### Added

- Added a `Workflow` facade to start defining a workflow.
- Added testing helpers to inspect workflow definitions
- Added testing helpers to check if a workflow was started

### Changed

- Workflows are now defined as standalone classes.
- Workflows no longer get started by chaining the `start` method on the builder.
  Instead, use the static `start` method on the workflow class itself.

### Removed

- Removed the static `new` method from the Workflow model. Use the `define`
  method on the `Workflow` facade instead.

## [0.9.0] â€“ 2020-10-20

### Added

- Add option to define a delay for a job.

## [0.8.0] â€“ 2020-10-12

### Changed

- Automatically register `WorkflowEventSubscriber` (shoutouts to [@phcostabh](https://twitter.com/phcostabh) for the suggestion)

## [0.7.0] â€“ 2020-10-12

### Added

- Adds support for Laravel 7 (previously only 8)

## [0.6.1] â€“ 2020-10-12

### Fixed

- Stops jobs of cancelled workflows from executing if they have already been scheduled but not yet picked up by a worker.

## [0.6.0] â€“ 2020-10-10

### Added

- Added `catch` method to workflow. This method will be called everytime a job inside a workflow is marked as failed.
- Make it possible to cancel a workflow. A cancelled workflow will not execute any further jobs, but will finish any job
  that was already running before the workflow got cancelled.
